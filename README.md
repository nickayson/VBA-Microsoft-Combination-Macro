# VBA-Microsoft-Combination-Macro
VBA macro designed for employees to copy from multiple sheets and paste automatically right under the last row of data.  
This can be either done in a one button process or with the users choice of desired cell range.  
These programs can be run multiple times and it will always print underneath the existing data.  
If a result file does not exist, it will automatically create one for the user.
